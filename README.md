# Estimating Election Incumbency Bias in General Elections in England

Fourth Year Research Project on Election Incumbency Bias in General Elections in England

This is a report which seeks to compute the incumbency bias (advantage in this context) incurred on a politician on account of their party and individual impact.

The report alongside all code used to produce the plots and models can be found in this repository.

For Section 3, python's Selenium and Beautiful Soup packages were used in order to extract information on the individual incumbency of General Election candidates in England; no data set is widely available online which gives this information.

All work in this project is my work unless stated otherwise. Please contact me on marwanlriach@hotmail.co.uk if you would like to discuss my novel method in measuring incumbency bias.
